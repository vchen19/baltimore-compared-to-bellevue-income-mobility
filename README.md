Recent sociology research and elevated cries for social justice have shaken the country’s faith in the “American Dream,” with increasing evidence that a child’s destiny is extremely closely tied to the neighborhood and circumstances they grow up in. [Empirical and anecdotal evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/upshot/an-atlas-of-upward-mobility-shows-paths-out-of-poverty.html) all point to the idea that it is unreasonable for policymakers to ask people to simply “pull themselves up by their bootstraps” to achieve success. Intergenerational [income has long been used as a method for measuring social mobility](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/33437/1/514190388.pdf). The ability of a child to move from a lower income percentile to a higher one is a sign that a society sufficiently provides the resources for people to overcome hardships and achieve better lives, a core facet of the “American Dream.”
