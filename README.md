## Background and Introduction

Recent sociology research and elevated cries for social justice have shaken the country’s faith in the “American Dream,” with increasing evidence that a child’s destiny is extremely closely tied to the neighborhood and circumstances they grow up in. [Empirical and anecdotal evidence](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/upshot/an-atlas-of-upward-mobility-shows-paths-out-of-poverty.html) all point to the idea that it is unreasonable for policymakers to ask people to simply “pull themselves up by their bootstraps” to achieve success. Intergenerational [income has long been used as a method for measuring social mobility](https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/33437/1/514190388.pdf). The ability of a child to move from a lower income percentile to a higher one is a sign that a society sufficiently provides the resources for people to overcome hardships and achieve better lives, a core facet of the “American Dream.” 

The two cities in comparison in this study are Bellevue, WA and Baltimore, MD. Bellevue has been rated by [USA Today as the 2nd best place to live in the United States](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2014/09/17/24-7-wall-st-50-best-cities-to-live/15736533/). [Nearly 24% of Baltimore’s population lives below the poverty line](https://money.cnn.com/2015/04/29/news/economy/baltimore-economy/). 

## Business question

How likely is it that a child whose parents come from the bottom 25% of income are able to advance an income quartile in Baltimore and in Bellevue? 

## Data Sources

Data was retrieved from [The Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org/), a data science project that uses Census data to evaluate various metrics of social mobility. [The specific dataset used for this analysis](https://github.com/vchen19/baltimore-compared-to-bellevue-income-mobility/blob/main/all_tract_household_income_low_parental_income.csv) consisted of average household income for those with low parental income (in the bottom 25%) for all Census tracts in the United States.
